## The PlayStation 2 and me...

Since I was a kid, I always thought the PlayStation 2 was the best console ever. This was mainly because it was the one console I played the most, as most of my friends had it, but I never owned one for various reasons and I always wanted one. Around 2020, I bought three of them, all broken to fix them and mod them as part of my electronics hobby and this is where my journey developing the PlayStation 2 started.

The Playstation 2 consoles I own are: one Silver SCPH-50005, one Silver SCPH-79001, one Black SCPH-79001 and one Black SCPH-90001.

Here you'll find some of my projects for the PlayStation 2 with a brief description about them.

## POPS-SMB-CONFIG

This software is meant to aid in configuring the IP addresses of the console itself and the SMB server for POPStarter over SMB on the console itself without the need to use a PC and a USB drive to copy files over.

The UI is drawn with text, so no fancy UI elements present. ~~I guess I'll have to learn how to use gsKit later on.~~

In the GitHub repo you'll find instructions on how to use it and how to build it along some screenshots. The compiled binaries can be found in the Releases page.

## OpenTuna Payload & Installer

I made some changes to the original OpenTuna Payload in order for it to build under the new PS2SDK without any legacy/windows dependecies. This means the final payload size is bigger, but it's still functional.

I also made some changes to the folder structure it expects to find on your memory card, as I have some sort of personal standard for it.

The buttons below take you to the Payload and Installer repos respectively, there you'll find all my changes (and how outdated it has become compared to the main repo lol).

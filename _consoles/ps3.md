## The PlayStation 3 and me...

The PlayStation 3 was my first "real" games console, I say "real" because all my previous consoles were some sort famiclone system. The first PlayStation 3 I got was a SuperSlim model, it was a christmas gift from my parents to me and my brother around 2013. I loved it as most of my friends already had one and we could play online games together.

Sadly, this PlayStation 3 died before it's first birthday and my parents managed to get another one (which is still thankfully alive). The dead one is the one you can see being modified in my YouTube videos, it is now alive and working fine as it had a dead power supply and I modified it to take ATX power supplies.

When browsing GameBrew for PlayStation 3 homebrew software, I came across SuperMarioWar and I fell in love with that game. This game is what got me into PlayStation 3 development (if it can be called development).

## SuperMarioWar

As stated before, this game is what launched my interest in programming for the PlayStation 3. While playing the game I noticed that some UI elements were a bit off and that there was no D-PAD input option, so I decided to download the source for the game and make some changes.

I added/changed some UI elements, added D-PAD support and built the game with the new PSL1GHT version. You can find the repository below along the releases PSX-Place pages.

## pkgi-ps3

This software allows users to download other software from user-created database files. It acts as some sort of Homebrew Store, with custom databases.

My contribution to this software came in the shape of minor changes in order to get it to compile under the Windows SDK (which is really outdated and not recommended for use). You can see the changes merged [here](https://github.com/bucanero/pkgi-ps3/commit/40c58a26a70e0d80a78b5ed22eef9567239c3873).
